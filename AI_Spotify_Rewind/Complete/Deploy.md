Awesome now to deploy

1. Publish the code to github
2. Deploy on Vercel (Make sure to upload all your secret keys)
3. Debug: Vercel might throw random errors — super normal. Don’t stress, even if it works first try or breaks. Code is all good. If stuck, just drop a message on Discord.

## Spotify Web App

As soon as you deploy, the things will not really work. This is because, remember in the start, we added localhost in the spotify dashboard. You will have to change it to your URL.

## Important

even after this It’ll work perfectly only on your account, but won’t for friends or family unless you add their emails. Spotify restricts API access to approved users. Just head to your Spotify dashboard → user management → add their emails. That’s it.

## **Please do this or Shrit will be sad.**
