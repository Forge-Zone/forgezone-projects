## **Who am I.**
My name is [Shrit](https://www.shrit.in/), and this is the first build of forge zone (wohoo)

**Random Highlights**: started building at 13, won hackathons, build games, get GitHub grad ‘23, build 100+ projects, built app around autism, got into hack club, helped my juniors to get in interstate F1, got first gig through GitHub open sourcing, started helping ppl by building websites pretty fast, helped agencies scale up

It might seem like I’ve done a lot but tbh at my core I’m just a fool figuring stuff out like everyone else.

[_Checkout a little intro video I made about this project below!_](https://www.loom.com/share/5a6901873b434314b8eeae00b32b2f06?sid=c74a2573-606a-4d91-b6bd-93c41934fd0f)

## **What you need to know to build this.**
Even though this is a beginner friendly project but you will need some pre-prerequisites html, tailwind and not much but little react js

- If you don’t know how to code in any language at all, my recommendation is you go [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) first. **Our specialty at forge zone isn’t teaching people to code from scratch**, there are much better platforms for that.
- If you know how to code a _little_ but aren’t that confident, see how far you get in this build! If you have issues or see obvious gaps in your knowledge, don’t worry. We’ve have a Discord community of builders that will be with you every step of the way!
- If you know how to code in any language, but have never used React -- you’ll be just fine. If you end up really struggling with React, you can learn it [here](https://scrimba.com/learn-nextjs-c02moisq6a).
- If you’re a pro I better see you at the end with a really fucking cool product. Inspire the rest of us!

Make sure to **connect your discord in the project dashboard.** All the good stuff is going to be happening in a secret category in the Discord that you'll only have access to if you connect your Discord.

## **All our content is fully open-source.**
All of the content you see here is 100% open-source.

If you see an issue in the content or want to make an addition, just make a PR and once it’s accepted it’ll be instantly updated here for everyone.

**Please check out the repo [here](https://github.com/forge-zone/forgezone-projects)** -- give it a star if you’re feeling nice! Helps us out a lot.

## How to get help
You’ll probably run into some roadblocks while building.

Whenever you run into something you can hit the Alec up directly in the Discord by doing `@shrit1401` to ping me. I’ll help you out

**Please keep all discussions around this build in the help sections of the `BUILD AN AI SPOTIFY REWIND` section on the Discord. If you start asking questions in random channels in the Discord you’ll piss us off lol.**

## Build In Public
Through this build, I’ll give you certain moments where you can tweet about what you’re building + give you pre-built tweets to inspire you to tell the world about what you're building.

There is zero harm in **building in public —** believe it or not, almost all the people I’ve met have helped me continue building great things I met because I tweeted / dm’ed / made connections randomly about what I was building lol.

I literally used to open source whatever I built and that’s how I got my first ever customer, because of which I got to know about freelancing and probably am here talking to you

**Never underestimate building in public.**

## **Please do this or Shrit will be sad.**
In `#spotify-rewind-general` — tell the world why you’re curious about doing this stuff. It’d be cool to understand why you’re curious about this stuff, what you’re trying to build, what inspired you to get into this, etc.

Also, this is a cool way to make some friends
