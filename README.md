üëã Hey! Want to level up by actually building?
[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/usAbhXav53). A space for devs who love building.

Here's what you'll get:

‚úÖ a group of internet friends to build with.

‚úÖ work on cool projects in web + AI

‚úÖ access to web experts who can answer any question you have.


## üìö Builds

At [forge zone](https://forgezone.dev) we take a lot of time to write projects that make sense and are just straight up fun! Just like software, we are bound to make some mistakes, but thats where you come in.

We made all these lessons Open Source so you can help make our projects even better and help others conquer the decentralized web ü§ò.

## üõ† Contributing

Any and all contributions are welcome! GitHub makes it _insanely_ easy to make contributions directly within their web app! [Follow this short guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository) on how to edit one of our Markdown lessons right here within GitHub!

Each project aligns with the content on your forge zone dashboard. Find the file you want to change and open up a Pull Request for it! Someone from the forge zone team will take a look at it ASAP!

## ü§î Why take this project on forge zone?
You have access to all of the content right here in GitHub!

   ### **Build With Others and With US!**
   You‚Äôre not alone. Join a small crew of devs building cool stuff together. Ask questions, share progress, and learn by doing ‚Äî all inside our Discord! Check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/usAbhXav53) to see what all the hype is about!

   ### **Chill Co-Working Vibes**
   Hop into casual co-working sessions where we code together, help each other out, and vibe to some Lo-Fi while shipping things that actually work.

   ### **Finish a Build. Earn Proof..**
   Complete a forge zone project, and you might just earn a surprise (üëÄ maybe a cool digital badge, maybe something more). We‚Äôre still experimenting.
